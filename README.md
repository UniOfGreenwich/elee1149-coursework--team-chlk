## Installation

### üê≥ Docker Quick Start

Fairshare is designed to run within a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) container for simplified setup and cross-enironment consistency.

<details>
<summary>Prerequisites</summary>
	
- **Docker:** Ensure Docker is installed and running. Download it from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com)
- **Internet Connection:** Required to pull Docker images.
-  **Basic Command-Line Familiarity:** You'll need to use basic command-line commands.

Ensure the following line is set to:
```
axios.defaults.baseURL = 'http://localhost:8080/'
```
To run the app locally: [axios.ts](frontend/src/methods/use-axios.ts) 
</details>

<summary>Running Fairshare</summary>

1. **Clone the repository:**
	  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/UniOfGreenwich/elee1149-coursework--team-chlk.git
    ```


2. Navigate the the project's root directory and run:

	```
	‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
	```

2. **Build and run:** Navigate to the project's root directory and run:

## Development

### Plugins (Gradle Dependencies) 

See the [Dependencies section](#dependencies) below for details on the project's Gradle dependencies.

<a id="dependencies"></a>

## Class Diagrams

For detailed class diagrams, please refer to the [class_diagrams](class_diagrams) folder.

## Security
Currently security features Password Ecnryption using [Encryption](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/crypto/bcrypt/BCryptPasswordEncoder.html)

In an ideal world the following feaures would have been added:
- Secret Manager to store the DB password (If we made the website public this should be hidden as is bad security showing the secret) Note this was attempted but GCP secret manager was not accepting it.
- API authentication (authenticate users before allowing api usage)
- Locking down endpoint (Only allow endpoints to be hit through the app internally and not through external means)

## Testing
Fairshare includes comprehensive testing in order to ensure the app is reliable and working at each stage of development.

### Backend Unit Tests
Unit tests for the backend services have been created to verify the functionality
of individual components. These tests can be found in the [test](src/test) directory.
To run theses tests, they will run when building the gradle file:
```bash
./gradlew build
```
or you can run the tests individually by executing the following command:
```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Testing Documents
In addition to automated test, we have followed some manual testing procedures through the
applications UI. We have maintained documentation of these testing documents that outline various
test cases, expected results and actual results. These documents help to maintain record
of manual testing and verify the application works. You can located these testing documents
in the [testing-documents](testing-documents) directory.

### Hopscotch Testing
#### What is Hopscotch
Hopscotch is an open-source API development tool that simplifies the process of testing and interacting
with APIs. Is provides a user-friendly interfact to send HTTP requests and view responses, making it easy to debug
and test API's. 

#### How we used Hopscotch
We used Hopscotch to test all our API endpoints for the Fairshare Application. This allowed us to ensure
our backend services were functioning correctly and returning the expected results, before passing in any 
data the Frontend. Here is the process of using Hopscotch to test our API's:

1. Setup Requests: We created various HTTP requests (GET, POST, DELETE, etc...) to interact with our API endpoints.
2. Send Requests: We sent these requests to the API and viewed the responses to ensure they were correct.
3. Validate Responses: We compared the actual responses with th expected results to verify the API was working correctly.
4. Debugging: If any issues were found, we used Hopscotch to debug the API and identify the root cause of the problem.

By using Hopscotch, we were able to quickly and easily test out API's ensuring reliablity and working status of our
backend services. 

More details can be found in the [hopscotch](testing-documents/hopscotch) directory.

### Physical Application Tests
Application test were performed as a group on 05/04/25 in person/virtual. A testing table was created by: Kyle, and listed the definitions of each
test and the expected vs actual results. The testing table can be found [table](testing-documents/test-table.md).
